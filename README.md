## Hey there, I'm Binh ✌🏼

I'm Binh. I've been a developer for 8+ years and have worked on the frontend, backend, in DevOps, and as an engineering manager. I've found myself moving back in the stack, but ulimately enjoy building things that make my customers' daily experiences better, whether those customers are workers in the field or fellow developers working a couple rows over.

Thanks for stopping by 🙏🏼

- 🚲 I’m currently working on an interactive urban bike route explorer, using [OSM data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap). See that [here](https://github.com/binhrobles/rusty-bikes)
- 🦀 I'm currently learning Rust! I'm enjoying the amount of intentionality it forces you to have with your software design
